# Software Verification Project

In this project, we verified some basic code in autoproof as well as quicksort & bucketsort in boogie.
The proofs for the sorting algorithms turned out to be not so trivial. However, we believe to have found good solutions.

Our report in `report` discusses the project and our solutions. We received a perfect grade for this project.
