2015/11/13 <mohlerm> Added basic quicksort implementation, however we should replace most of the return types by call-by-value (i simply have no clue how to do this in boogey)
2015/11/15 <mohlerm> Instead of call-by-value I simply made the array global. Not nice, but maybe that's the way to go? At least the examples do it like this (dutchflag example)
